During the programming I had many difficulties solving the problems. I have tried my best to complete the lab. I have done the 3 commands. I didn't get the change command to work and I couldn't figure out how to do the garbage commands so I did not complete that part of the code and I couldn't figure out the delete commands.

I have not successfully completed the lab but I have done my best. I could have been more efficient but due to the midterm.
